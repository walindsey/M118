##Assessment Problems
In this document, you will find all of the book assessment problems for the different modules.  Each lesson is separated into three parts, labeled:  **CC**, **P**, and **AA**.  The **CC** problems are the *core concept* problems; every student is expected to be able to do these problems.  Problems marked with a **P** are strictly for practice after the lesson.  Problems marked with **AA** are *advanced application* problems - they delve into the heart of why the mathematics works.

###How to approach each lesson
Each lesson is going to be broken up into three parts, two of which you will be responsible for.

**Before Class**: (1 hour) You will be given a lesson (usually in video form) and a worksheet to discover some new information.  At this time, you will be expected to do the **CC** problems to check to see how well you understand the lesson.  These problems must be prepared and brought to class.

**In Class**:  As a class, we will do activities to help you further understand the lesson.  The form that this takes will vary, but usually it will involve group or individual work to tackle some of the more involved applications.  Every class period, you will be given (at least) one example problem so you can see what the *Core Concept* problems will look like on the Module test.

**After Class**:  (1-2 hours) For practice, you will have a set of **P** problems.  This will be a few more of the basic problems and a few application problems.  I will also provide you with a set of **AA** problems that will help prepare you for the *Advanced Application* problems on the Module test.

###Grades for Daily Homework

All three of these assessments are *formative* assessments, i.e. they help you to understand what you do not understand.  As such, they will only be graded for completion.  You will receive a **daily score** of a 0, 1 or 2 based on whether you did the **CC** problems for the day.  A zero means that you did not try *most* of the problems or that you are not in class.  A one means you made a good faith effort on *some* of the problems.  A two means that you made a good faith effort on *all* of the problems.
