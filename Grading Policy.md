#M118 Grading Policy
----
Your grade will be earned through three or four different categories:  **Daily Homework**, **Module Tests**, a **Final Exam**, and potentially an **Advanced Bundle**.  You will have freedom to choose how much you would like to do as long as you meet minimum requirements for the grade level you desire.  How each of these categories are structured and assessed is outlined in the following:

* **Daily Homework**:  You will receive homework every day that is to be completed between each class period.  This homework will be graded on a completion basis.
* **Module Test**:  At the end of each *Module*, there will be a test that is split into two parts.  The first part will be required of everybody and will assess the core concepts of the module.  The second part is only for students aiming for an A or a B and will assess the more advanced topics from the module.  Each problem will be graded as **Pass** or **No Pass** depending on whether your work shows mastery of the concept being assessed.
* **Final Exam**:  There is a departmental final exam that takes place on *Monday, May 4*. **I am still not sure how I will assess this**.
* **Advanced Bundle**:  For students aiming for an A or a B, I will give you opportunities throughout the semester to explore the material in greater depth.  You will have additional homework to do between classes to prepare you for the harder problems on the **Module Tests**.  The only assessment for this bundle is on the **Module Tests**.

Here I would put the table that gives each grade level.

Then a paragraph encouraging them to stretch themselves.

Now I'll outline each of the four categories in more detail.
