M118 - Finite Mathematics

#Specs

To complete any module, a student must complete the following tasks:

* Complete the *basic assessment* before each class period in a satisfactory manner.
* Answer 80% of the Core Concepts problems on the exam correctly.
* Participate in the in-class activity each day.

There will be two assessments between each class period.  The first, the *basic assessment* will measure whether you know and understand the foundational information for this particular section.  It will include some assessment problems designed to gauge whether you understand the facts.

The second assessment will be an *advanced assessment*.  It will give you a chance to apply the given information in a more interesting context.

There will be five midterm exams in the course - one for each Module.  Midterm exams will be split up into two parts, the **Core Concepts** and the **Advanced Applications**.  Each student must complete 80% of the questions in the **Core Concepts** correctly to pass the exam.  If, in addition, the student completes 75% of the **Advanced Application** problems correctly, they will receive credit towards the *Advanced Bundle*.

###Tokens

Each student will start off with (?) tokens.  These tokens may be redeemed throughout the semester for the following benefits:

* Turn in an assessment up to 24 hours late
* Drop *one* assessment grade
* Miss the in-class activity for one day
* Skip one problem on a Midterm exam or the final exam.  A skipped problem will count as correct.  (No more than one token can be used per midterm; there is no such restriction on the final.)

For the last one, this will allow an easier cutoff for the different assessment levels.  For example, if you need to get 8 out of the 10 problems from the Core Concepts part of a Midterm, this will allow you to only need 7 for the same credit.  Alternatively, it will allow you to skip problems on the final exam to make the 70% cutoff easier to reach.

I will remain open to suggestions for other uses of tokens - you will probably think of creative ways to cash them in.

##Module 1 - Counting and Sets

In this module, students will learn the basics of set theory and will learn how to count the number of possibilities for various events using the Multiplication Principle, permutations, and combinations.

**CS1**:  *Introduction to Sets*

Basic Assessment:  Watch the video introducing you to set theory, following along with the provided worksheet.  Then complete the following problems from section 5.1 in your textbook.

Advanced Assessment:  In addition to the *Basic Assessment*, complete the following problems from section 5.1 in the textbook.

**Maybe these should be in a different place - a separate page that contains all of the assessment problems**	


**CS2**:  *A Counting Principle*

Basic Assessment:  Watch the videos on various counting techniques, following along with the provided worksheet.  Then complete the following problems from section 5.2 in your textbook.

Advanced Assessment:  In addition to the *Basic Assessment*, complete the following problems from section 5.2 in the textbook.

##Module 2 - Probability

In this module, students will learn how to use the counting techniques acquired in the first module to find out the likelyhood of various events.  They will encounter basic probability, conditional probability, independence, and Baye's theorem, as well as the use of tree diagrams and complements in computing probabilities.  In addition, they will discover probabilities in a Binomial context and the concept of Expected Value.

##Module 3 - Linear Programming

In this module, students will learn the very basics of Linear Programming, including setting up feasible sets for programs of 2 variables, identifying objective functions, and then applying the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming to maximize or minimize an objective over a feasible set.

##Module 4 - Matrices

In this module, students will learn how to manipulate matrices.  They will learn how to set up an augmented matrix from a system of linear equations, how to use Gauss-Jordan elimination to both solve a system and to find inverses, and how to multiply and add matrices together, when appropriate.

##Module 5 - Markov Processes

In this module, students will learn the basics of Markov processes and learn how to find long term behavior of both regular and absorbing processes.

##Advanced Bundle

To complete this bundle, a student must complete the following:

* Advanced Applications on four of the five midterm exams
* At least 80% of the Advanced Assessments over the course of the semester.

#Grades
Grades will be assigned based on the following criteria:

* **F** - You will receive an *F* if you fail to meet the criteria for a *D*.
* **D** - You will receive a *D* if you complete at least 3 of the 5 modules satisfactorally and score at least a 50% on the final exam.
* **C** - You will receive a *C* if you complete at least 4 of the 5 modules satisfactorally and score at least a 70% on the final exam.
* **B** - You will receive a *B* if you complete every bundle satisfactorally and score at least a 70% on the final exam.
* **A** - You will receive an *A* in the course if you complete every bundle satisfactorally, receive at least a 70% on the final exam, and complete the *Advanced Bundle*.
